[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3b019f98-183b-4906-937e-3457ee3b2f68/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/konosuba-fda/deploys)

A web interface for browsing assets from [Konosuba: Fantastic Days](https://konosubafd.jp).
This project provides an organized way to explore game assets by parsing and displaying content from the following repositories:

## 📦 Asset Sources
  - [HaiKonofanDesu/konofan-assets-jp-sortet](https://github.com/HaiKonofanDesu/konofan-assets-jp-sortet): Game textures and spine models
  - [HaiKonofanDesu/konofan-live2d](https://github.com/HaiKonofanDesu/konofan-live2d): Live2D models
  - [HaiKonofanDesu/konofan-audio](https://github.com/HaiKonofanDesu/konofan-audio): BGM and sound files
  - [HaiKonofanDesu/konofan-videos](https://github.com/HaiKonofanDesu/konofan-videos): Video content
  - [HaiKonofanDesu/konofan-story](https://github.com/HaiKonofanDesu/konofan-story): Story scripts

## 🔍 How it Works

This browser automatically organizes and displays assets by parsing their file paths as the single source of truth.
Assets are categorized and made searchable based on their location and naming within the source repositories.
